# Giancarmine Sparso

**`Physics student`**

I’m a physics student building scientific systems from first principles.
Every project is developed from the ground up from theoretical modeling and mathematical formulation to implementation in code and hardware.
For the moment my work focuses on computational physics and detector design, combining rigorous foundations with practical execution.
